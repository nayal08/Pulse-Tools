These HSI's are then detokenized and borrowed against by the contract to be sent to the Hedron liquidation auction 90 days later.\n\nFeature 2 (HDRN Staking) Stake HDRN for ICSA, the daily yield is determined by the amount of daily HDRN burnt within the Hedron contract. There are minimum stake lengths and bonuses associated with stake size\n\nFeature 3 (ICSA Staking) Stake ICSA for both HDRN and ICSA. Like HDRN staking, ICSA yield comes from daily burnt HDRN. HDRN yield comes from borrowed HSI HEX stakes and EES penalties collected by the contract over time\n\nFeature (We Are All the SA) You have to option to purchase an NFT from the Icosa contract which earns yield in ICSA during the limited \"We Are All the SA\" event. There is no set price, the price you choose determines the amount of stake points the NFT is allocated. Like HDRN staking, yield is determined by the amount of burnt HDRN each day. After the event entry phase has ended, no more entries can be made into the staking pool. The percentage of the staking pool your NFT is allocated determines your percentage of the daily yield in perpetuity. If other NFT holders end their stakes and claim their yield, they cannot re-enter. To end the stake and claim the yield, you must exit the staking pool.

The primary tool in our arsenal is the native PulseChain wallet we are building. The Internet Money Wallet aims to be the easiest onboarding experience for new crypto users. We will accomplish this by providing users an intuitive UI (user interface) and approachable branding that helps bridge the gap from legacy finance, to crypto. Additionally, all users who download our app will be able to claim free PLS and free Internet Money (IM). What about advanced crypto users? We will have features that even the most advanced crypto user will appreciate. The Internet Money Wallet will be an IOS app, Android app and Chrome Browser Extension.\n\nThis is a two token ecosystem, Internet Money (IM) and Internet Money Dividend (IMD).\n\nIM is a peer to peer digital cash. No admin keys, no taxes, no reflections and is deflationary. IM was launched on BSC on 11/29/2021. Holders of IM on BSC will get a 1:1 copy when IM launches on PulseChain. IM also exists on PulseChain testnet.\n\nIMD is the first token of its kind. The Internet Money Wallet will generate fees when swaps from one token to another are performed within the wallet (like other crypto wallets). Unlike other crypto wallets, these fees will be distributed back to the holders of the IMD token! Example: If you hold IMD on PulseChain, you will receive fees that are generated on PulseChain within the wallet. The coolest part? These fees are generated in the blockchains native coin. Holding IMD on PulseChain = Passive income in the form of PLS. Staking, delegating or locking up your IMD is NOT required to earn your passive income. Simply, hold IMD in a wallet you own the private keys to.\n\nCrypto Currency was created to be a decentralized way to interact with money.

In addition, fees from the BEETroot Anon Crypto Exchange aggregator will be used to buy & burn BEET, creating ongoing & increasing buy pressure while deflating supply.\n\nTokenomics & Black Hole:\n\n20% of the initial supply will go straight into the official burn address to create a giant black hole, which attracts the reflections and sucks up supply in a disproportionate measure. See it as an eternally & provably locked friendly OA in reverse, the benefits without the keys and risk.\n\nThe black hole will keep growing and accelerating deflation, both from reflections and ever bigger buy & burns as the exchange grows.\n\nThis enables a super small traders tax of only 2% in total to make a huge impact on deflation, combined with the buy & burns.\n\nRewards:\n\nHodlers are rewarded by way of auto reflections from the 2% traders tax, simply by holding BEET in their wallet. No staking is required, your balance will increase in real time from all global BEET trades on the dex, while the total supply deflates.\n\nBuy & Burn:\n\nFees from BEETroot Anon Exchange are used to buy back & burn BEET at random times so the buy pumps can't be gamed. This creates ongoing & increasing long term buy pressure from it's own protocol. A self feeding cycle that will trigger further buying from the wider market, all while reducing supply on the burn.\n\nDeflationary:\n\nIn addition, there is the black hole sucking ever larger amounts of supply from it's share of both the reflections & the buy back & burns, forever growing & accelerating deflation.", "Youtube_link": "https://youtube.com/embed/qH-j0shhOUw?modestbranding=1"}, {"Token_name": "Pulse Abides", "Token_Symbol": "https://pulsehotlist.com/img/apps/Pulse%20Abides.png", "Description": "YouTuber based airdrop token", "Token_link": "https://pulsehotlist.com/thepulseabides.info", "Type": "Token", "PHL_Score": "41", "Tags": ["Airdrop", "Sacrifice"], "Social_Links": ["https://twitter.com/the_pulseabides", "https://t.me/ThePulseAbidesToken", "https://youtube.com/ThePulseAbides", "https://discord.gg/F4gRrnzkGr"], "Reputation": "Reputation\nTwitter account got suspended.

Genius is, furthermore, immune to human corruption and biased bureaucracy. Genius is the first hyper-yield A.I. blockchain Certificate of Deposit that aspires to appreciate. Genius will be used by end users to generate passive income.\n\nFunctionally, and \"under the hood\" of the software engine, Genius is an Ethereum- and PulseChain-based smart contract that is immutable, which means that the code cannot be changed. Genius has no admin key, meaning that it cannot be exploited by any human or privileged access. Furthermore, it has no \"developer coins\" and the users cannot be \"rug pulled\". These are marketing-specific industry terms that mean value cannot be stolen from end users of the Genius Smart Financial Contract.\n\nGenius is designed to enforce a positive, healthy, and democratic financial market by defending its value from typical negative market activities. This is done by incentivizing users to \"lock away\" their value for a length of time promised by the end user. For users who change their mind about their promises, or neglect to attend to their promises, their wealth is redistributed to the smart contract's good actors over time until they re-engage their commitment. An A.I. layer continuously monitors the end users' actions and reevaluates incentives for the benefit of end users who keep their promises. With Genius, your time (attention) and your intentions (promises) are reflected as value. In other words, Genius's internal artificial intelligence constantly considers the end users' actions, evaluates the likeliness that a user will break their promise(s), and adjusts the reward incentives to entice users to stick to their original promises. In layman's terms: Genius is also designed to protect its users from the effects of market manipulation, negative market conditions, and human greed and impatience.\n\nUtility. Genius can be used to store value (save) and generate passive income over a period of time. This is done by \"Genius Mining\". Similar to Bitcoin Mining, the new Genius tokens are only paid out to those who are mining for Genius. With Bitcoin Mining, you need to purchase expensive mining equipment, use lots of electricity, and trust a mining pool. With Genius Mining, all you need is the Genius Token and to create a dedicated pledge (promise) to generate passive income. Unlike with Bitcoin Mining, Genius Mining has no need for expensive equipment and useless computations that ultimately burn through electricity.\n\nWhite paper: https://geni.to/smartcontract\n\nGenius is in development and is estimated to be released late summer 2022", "Youtube_link": "https://youtube.com/embed/oXuLCgDf994?modestbranding=1"}, {"Token_name": "WAIT", "Token_Symbol": "https://pulsehotlist.com/img/apps/WAIT.png", "Description": "PulseChain pre-release token", "Token_link": "https://pulsehotlist.com/0xwait.com", "Type": "Meme", "PHL_Score": "39", "Tags": ["Working", "Airdrop"], "Social_Links": ["https://twitter.com/0xcoast", "https://t.me/Coast0x", "https://reddit.com/r/0xCoast"], "Reputation": "Reputation\nMeme coin (no utility/highly volatile asset class).\n\nGood whitepaper.

The SNOW HILL contract is a low risk high return contract that is similar to a high yield certificate of deposit. Players can roll $FLAKE tokens down the SNOW HILL, receiving 1% daily returns up to 365%. In order to participate, players must join another player's SnowBall team, and purchase $FLAKE tokens from the platform's swap page. Players can compound their rewards by rolling their interest into the SNOW HILL to see their funds rise exponentially, i.e. the SnowBall effect. The SNOW HILL will always be able to provide the rewarded $FLAKE tokens based on the game theory outlined in this whitepaper.", "Youtube_link": "https://youtube.com/embed/D3qOTrhSwm4?modestbranding=1"}, {"Token_name": "Terrapulse", "Token_Symbol": "https://pulsehotlist.com/img/apps/Terrapulse.png", "Description": "Future Of Finance On PulseChain", "Token_link": "https://pulsehotlist.com/terrapulse.xyz", "Type": "DeFi", "PHL_Score": "2", "Tags": ["Sacrifice"], "Social_Links": [], "Reputation": "Reputation\nWebsite has almost no information.

As a newly launched blockchain, PulseChain needs developers to build their projects on our network. New projects launched on PulseChain means an influx of capital, users, and communities. The more successful projects we have on our network the more will join, creating a flywheel effect. A single successful DeFi project can bring in millions of users, all of whom will need $PLS to transact. And the more people that need $PLS, the more valuable it becomes.
